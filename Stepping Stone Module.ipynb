    "Lists are a data type in Python and can be used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are created by using square brackets [] and listing the items on the list, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> myList = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that the items in the list are listed in between \" \". We can separate the items in the list through a comma. There is no limit to the number of items we can have in the list, and we can even delete or add items to the list later.\n",
    "A list is always ordered, which means that the order will not change. If we add items to our list, they will be placed at the end of the list. A list also allows for duplicates, which means that we can add the same item to the list twice.\n",
    "If we want to print our list, we call a print statement followed by our list, for example:\n",
    "> print(myList)\n",
    "\n",
    "This will print the content of the list.\n",

    "This will add \"Orange\" to the myList list. We now have a list myList = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"orange\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "All lists in Python are indexed, which means that each item has an index number. The first item has index[0],the second item has index[1]. \n",
    "We can also print items that are located at a specific index. Remember, the first item in the list has index[0], so if we want to retrieve the first item in the list, we can call the following command:\n",
    "> myList[0]\n",
    "\n",

    "If we now print the list again, you will notice that apple has been removed. \n",
    "If you now call print(myList[0]), what do you think is going to happen?\n",

    "If we dont specifiy pop and just call myList.pop(), this will automatically remove the last item in the list.\n",

    "In some cases, we might want to delete the entire list. We can do this by calling del myList. But be careful - this does not only remove the items, it deletes the entire list so it no longer exists. If we want to work with the list again, we will have to re-create it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before deleting a list, it might be better to clear it instead. This will remove all items from the list, but the list still exists - as an empty list.\n",
